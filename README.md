# BubbleTalk

To run this chatbox interface locally, make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. First, clone the repository and open the project folder. Navigate to the server directory in your terminal and run npm install to install backend dependencies. Create a .env file in the server folder with your MongoDB URI and a JWT secret. Then, start the backend server using node server.js. For the frontend, simply open the client/index.html file in your browser.
